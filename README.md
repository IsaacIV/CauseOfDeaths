# CauseOfDeaths

I am not an expert. I am just exploring and practicing data Science on this dataset that I got from kaggle. This is the link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ivanchvez/causes-of-death-our-world-in-data/code

- These datasets have the causes of deaths from around the year by country and year
- I am looking at the top ten deaths for Mexico and the United States
